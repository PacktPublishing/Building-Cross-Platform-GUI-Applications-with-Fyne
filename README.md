**Create beautiful, platform-agnostic graphical applications using Fyne and the Go programming language**

## What is this book about?
The history of graphical application development is long and complicated, with various development challenges that persist to this day. The mix of technologies involved and the need to use different programming languages lead to a very steep learning curve for developers looking to build applications across multiple platforms. 

This book covers the following exciting features:
Become well-versed with the history of GUI development and how Fyne and the Golang programming language make it easier
Explore how the Fyne toolkit is architected and the various modules are provided
Discover how Fyne apps can be tested and constructed using best practices
Construct five complete applications and deploy them to your devices
Customize the design of your apps by extending widgets and themes
Understand the separation and presentation of data and how to test and build applications that present dynamic data
